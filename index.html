<p class="paragraph">Derby: Derby shoes, which emerged in England in the 1800s, are considered a more comfortable alternative to Oxford models. In derby models, the lace holes are located on the side panels. Offering a stylish option, derby shoes are suitable for combination with both suits and jeans.

  Loafer: Loafer shoes, which have closure details such as straps and buckles, successfully adapt to formal or casual environments. Produced in Norway in the 1930s, these shoes became popular among Hollywood stars in the 1960s. Standing out with their comfort, loafer shoes are made of leather or suede. You can use men's loafer shoe models, which are available in every color, at work, special events or in daily life.</p>

      <p>Classic shoe models consist of options such as Oxford, derby and loafer. Each of the models stands out with its wide range of use and quality material structure. Details about the most preferred classic shoe models can be listed as follows:

        Oxford: Oxford models, which have been used since the 19th century, were popularized by Oxford University students. In Oxford shoes, which have been considered a complete classic since then, the lace holes are sewn to the upper part of the shoe. A stylish alternative for formal environments, the products can be stylishly combined with suits and fabric trousers.</p>

    <p class="talke ysl"> it’s just all perfect! They are exquisite and the shoe being named ‘Jamie’ is just the cherry on top (even though the spelling is slightly off since my name is spelled ‘Jaime’). Some of the brand’s other styles are more simple and classic, making them ideal for everyday wear and more work appropriate. This style comes in two versions, one with crystals on the inner part of the sweeping fur and one without crystals. Of course, I chose the version with crystals! I am always on the hunt for shoes that make a statement and these were love at first sight.</p>

      She quickly became Yves Saint Laurent’s favorite model, despite not having the measurements usually associated with runway models―she was smaller and less slender. And yet it was her way of wearing and embodying the garment that made such an impression on the young couturier.Victoire followed Yves Saint Laurent when he founded his own fashion house in 1961.<br>EGP 70000,00
